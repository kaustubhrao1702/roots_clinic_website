            Elevating the level of Care in Dental Practice. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Roots Dental are the First to introduce the use of Surgial Operatting Microscope from Carl Zeiss, Germany for Root Canals Treatment in India.    
        <br>
        <br>
            This advanced technology is featured with Digital documentation and helps us greatly in delivering highly Efficient and Precision based treatments.
        <br>
        <br>
            Microscopes are a great tool which assists us to Diagnose, Treat and Identify those which is not commonly seen by our anked eyes.
       <br>
       <br>
            They provide best visualization and illumination of the tooth, thereby enabling us to treat challenging cases which is not treatable by convention approaches, leading to the highly successful outcomes of the treatment.

<h4>Digital Radiography</h4>
<div class="img2"> <img src="img/3.jpeg" alt="this is an image" width="600">
    <p>
        Digital radiology is a form of x-ray imaging, where digital x-ray sensors are used instead of traditional photographic film.
    <br><br>
        Significantly reduces radiation exposure by 90% and images can be stored and transferred digitally.
    <br><br>
        At Roots Dental we use Digital Dental Radiology from Schick, Germany.
